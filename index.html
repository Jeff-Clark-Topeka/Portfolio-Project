                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>Throughout my life I have always taken interest in technology. I loved learning what all a device could do. In high school I took a basic Intro to Web Development Course and loved the idea of making web pages, however at the time didn't see myself being able to code. More recently I took part in a coding bootcamp and fell in love with the idea of coding. While I didn't finish the bootcamp, it helped me learn my passion for web development. I have always been good at working with others, I love the idea of working with a team to achieve a common goal. It is my belief that everyone plays a key part in building something big and that it is the collection of our ideas that can make a project so great!</p>

                <p>Outside of web development, my interests include: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gaming</li>
                    <li>Horror Movies</li>
                    <li>Biking</li>
                    <li>Being Outdoors</li>
                </ul>
